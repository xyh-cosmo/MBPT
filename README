=====================================   Useage  ===================================
    complie & link the gsl libs
        $ make
    run the code
        $ make run
    clear the complied obj-files
        $ make clean
============================ Initial Condition (z=1020)  ==========================
    Initial condition is obtained from cmbfast, using adiabatic intial condtions for 
    the moment.

    In the code MBPT, intial conditions is stored in :
        deltac[],
        deltab[],
        thetac[],
        thetab[].
    [[[ BE CAREFUL !!! ]]]
    the size of the arrays and kmin & kmax should be modified when the corresponding 
    input of cmbfast is changed.!!!
